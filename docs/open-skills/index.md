# Open Skills Project

 The Open Skills Project is focused on providing a dynamic, up-to-date, locally-relevant, and normalized taxonomy of skills and jobs that builds on and expands on the Department of Laborâ€™s O*NET data resources. This taxonomy is aimed at two groups:
 
- Developers, by way of the [Open Skills API](http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/)
- Researchers, using tabular data sets (coming soon!)

To produce this output, a variety of extraction and processing tasks are used across four different code repositories.

- skills-public-etl (under construction) contains utilities for extracting job listings from our public data partners, transforming them into a common job listing schema, and loading them into an S3 bucket.
- [skills-ml](http://github.com/workforce-data-initiative/skills-ml) contains processing algorithms and utilities for computing our jobs and skills taxonomy.
- skills-airflow (under construction) contains an orchestration workflow using the Airflow project that combines tasks from our skills-public-etl and skills-ml tasks to create aggregated data suitable for public consumption. This aggregated data is output both in relational database format suitable for the Open Skills API and tabular datasets suitable for researchers.
- [skills-api](http://github.com/workforce-data-initiative/skills-api) contains a Flask application that runs the Open Skills API, making available data generated by the skills-airflow repository for developer use.
