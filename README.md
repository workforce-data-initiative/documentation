Technical documentation for DataAtWork, including detailed documentation of the Open Skills Project and the Training Provider Outcomes Toolkit.

Documentation for DataAtWork is written in Markdown, and compiled using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). If you are familiar with MkDocs, you can skip the instructions below.

## MkDocs Basics

For those unfamiliar with MkDocs, below are some instructions for getting started. More comprehensive and up-to-date documentation will always be available at the [MkDocs website](http://www.mkdocs.org)

### Installation

One easy way to install MkDocs is through pip.

- `pip install mkdocs`

### Manual Build

To just run the build process, run `mkdocs build` in the root directory. It will convert your Markdown documentation and output HTML to the site/ directory.

### Development Server

When modifying a lot of documentation, it can help to not have to rebuild every time you want to check your documentation. Run `mkdocs serve` in the root directory, and open the URL it returns. This will automatically build your docs as you update the files.
